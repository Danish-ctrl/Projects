# Projects
These are the few small project or few lines of codes which I wrote while learning Python.In Guess_The_Number.txt file it is going to guess the number which user gives as input and gives hint if input number is not correct with limited number of guesses.In Health_Mgmt_System.txt file ,it is going to manage the daily diet routine of patients and log it in a file with diet name,time and date.In Pattern(Star)_making file it is taking some random number as input and generating a pattern like stars. In Snake_Water_Gun.txt file, user can directly interact with the system and play the game based on three randomly generated variables like snake, water and gun.It is same as that of rock,paper and scissor game.In jarvis.py file, a desktop assistant is created which takes your voice as input and gives your response in voice.
